BUGS:
- Space at the end of highscore list
"View your Canvas, and use the four anchors on your UI elements. It'll take some adjusting, but it will resize to any screen. I'd recommend editing these on a 16:9 ratio to ensure it resizes correctly."
- Some scripts/emojis don't appear on in-game highscore list
- Some scripts/letters mess with UI placement
- Arabic and Hebrew fix
- Perfect anchoring of UI elements
- Flag placement in high score list is inconsistent
- Change Libya flag (maybe some others?)

DON'T FORGET:
- SWITCH MONETIZATION SWIPE TO FALSE
